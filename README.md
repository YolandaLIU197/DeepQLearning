# DeepQLearning Stock Trading Agent 

This project implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent that learns to trade a single stock using reinforcement learning. The agent observes a simplified environment defined by its portfolio state — number of stocks owned, cash in hand, and the current stock price — and takes actions (Buy, Sell, Hold) to maximize cumulative profit. The model learns through experience replay, epsilon-greedy policy, and a multi layer perceptron. This simulation uses synthetic or real stock price data and visualizes trading behavior and portfolio performance over time.
